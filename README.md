# CODSOFT AI Internship Tasks

## Project Overview

This repository contains AI internship tasks completed as part of the **CODSOFT AI Internship program**. Each task demonstrates different AI concepts and implementation approaches:

- **Task 1**: Rule-Based Chatbot using pattern matching
- **Task 2**: Tic-Tac-Toe AI with unbeatable Minimax algorithm
- **Task 5**: Face Detection and Recognition using Haar Cascade and LBPH

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot

A conversational AI that uses pattern matching and IF-ELSE conditions to respond to user inputs. Handles greetings, basic intents, and provides fallback responses.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Regular Expressions

### Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where human players compete against an unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning optimization.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Minimax Algorithm

### Task 5: Face Detection and Recognition

An AI application that detects and recognizes faces in images using Haar Cascade classifiers and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) face recognition.

**Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV, Computer Vision

## How to Run Each Task

### Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot

```bash
cd Task1_Rule_Based_Chatbot
python main.py
```

### Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

```bash
cd Task2_TicTacToe_AI
python main.py
```

### Task 5: Face Detection and Recognition

```bash
cd Task5_Face_Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Dependencies

Each task has its own `requirements.txt` file with specific dependencies:

- **Task 1**: Python standard library only (re, random)
- **Task 2**: Python standard library only
- **Task 5**: opencv-python, opencv-contrib-python, numpy
